## 🤔 what's in a name?

- My name is often confused with more common names like `leila` or `lila`, but I assure you, it's different — and probably how I managed to snag [this handle](https://github.com/lelia) 😛
- How to pronounce `lelia`? It's somewhat up for interpretation, but the easiest way to remember is that it's like `amelia`, `delia`, `celia` — just with an `"L"`.
- What does my name mean? Well, if noted authority [babynamewizard.com](https://www.babynamewizard.com/baby-name/girl/lelia) is to be believed:

> `Lelia` is a contracted variant of `Eulalia`, a compound name composed of the Greek elements `eu` (_well, good, fair_) and `lalein` (_to talk_): hence, "_well-spoken_".

Hey, I'll take it!

## 👩‍💻 what do I do?

- I'm currently an [Open Source Technical Leader](https://www.linkedin.com/in/le1ia) for [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com)'s [Emerging Tech & Incubation](https://opensource.cisco.com) organization. Previously, I served as a founding member and Platform Lead for [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com)'s [Open Source Program Office](https://wayfair.github.io), as well as Staff Engineer for their Development Platforms organization :octocat:
- Prior to open source work, I was Tech Lead for a centralized team which created frictionless, language-agnostic testing experiences for developers — with a particular focus on adopting open-source tools like [Pact](https://github.com/pact-foundation) and [Karate](https://github.com/intuit/karate), and creating plugins for integration with [Buildkite](https://github.com/buildkite) — a CI platform for the modern era!
- Before _all_ of that, I worked at a handful of technology companies — spanning everything from [enterprise security](https://www.sophos.com/) to [storage servers](https://editshare.com/) to [consumer robotics](http://jibo.com/) 🤖

## 💻 how do I work?

- I'm a big fan of keyboard shortcuts, workflow improvement, and [automating things](https://github.com/lelia/easy-mac).
- My preferred [Terminal-based](https://iterm2.com/) text editor is [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), but I won't fight you if you use [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) 🤓
- For IDEs, I tend to stick with [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) (for Bash, Python, PHP, Javascript, etc.) and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (for Java and Rust) — _always_ with Vim key bindings.
- Since I hail from a non-CS background (_film major!_), I'm always on the lookout for unique and interesting ways to learn. If given the choice between a densely-packed textbook and an interactive tutorial which teaches practical applications of a technical concept, I'll choose the latter every time.

## ✨ what else do I do?

- After displaying a degree of helplessness in the kitchen that led to my mom gifting me the book [How to Boil Water](https://www.amazon.com/Boil-Water-Food-Network-Kitchens/dp/0696226863), I decided it was time to learn how to cook — and accidentally wound up loving it 👩‍🍳 As with programming, I've found that the more you learn, the more you realize how much _more_ there is to know — which is both terrifying and exciting. I'm especially fond of sauces and spices, and enjoy blending traditional flavors from different cuisines to create new culinary experiences in Flavortown ™️
- I also love languages and linguistics, and consider myself a lifelong learner — which extends to my native language, English! I've spent the most time studying Spanish — helped by my brief stint living in Miami 🇨🇺 — and know a little 🇮🇹 Italian and French 🇫🇷, too. As a stretch goal, I'd love to learn conversational Cantonese 🇭🇰
